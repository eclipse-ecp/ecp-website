<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<p>Everyone is invited to getting involved with the EMF Client project. Before you plan any kind of contribution, it is a good idea to contact the <a href="communication.php">project team</a>.<br /> Contributing may include:<br /> <ul> <li>Writing bug reports: Please provide a short and concise explanation of the problem, a snippet to reproduce the issue, ideally a JUnit test case that outlines the expected behavior. See the <a href="support.php">support page</a> for details. You are also invited to enter feature requests.<br /> </li> <li>Providing a patch to an existing bug report: If you are no committer on the project, please upload your bug report in the <a href="support.php">bugzilla</a><br /> </li> <li>Contribute documentation, i.e. if you found something which is not documented yet, please share you knowledge with other users. Please <a href="communication.php">contact us</a>, to find the appropriate place to add your documentation.</li> </ul></p>

<h2>Developer Resources for the Juno version of EMF Client Platform</h2>

<p>This tutorial describes how to install the  workspace  for the Juno branch of EMF Client Platform using Buckminster. Please note that this branch will not be compatible to version 0.9.x if you want to develop based on version 0.9.x, please see <a href="gettinginvolved.php">here</a></p>
<p>Please download and install Eclipse 3.7 from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads</a></p>
<p>Please install buckminster from this update site: <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/buckminster/updates-3.7">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/buckminster/updates-3.7</a>. You will need the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buckminster - Core</li>
<li>Buckminster - Subversive Support</li>
<li>Buckminster - PDE Support<li> 
</ul>

<p>Please install the EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo>http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo</a>"</p>
<p>For the target platfrom first create an empty project called "_target"</p>
<p>Now create an empty target definition that Buckminster later can fill with the needed plug-ins (Windows->Preferences->Plugin Development->Target Platform) </p>
<p>Add the directory location ${workspace_loc}/_target. Activate the platform</p>
<p>Manually check-out the releng project from the other repository /ECP2</p>
<p>To materialize the sources right-click the local.mspec, select Buckminster|Import... Click finish and wait until the import is finished, this might take several hours.</p>


<p>
The final step is to create a check style configuration. We are using checkstyle 5. Please open the global preferences (Window => Preferences) and add a new Checkstyle configuration named "emfstoreStyle" with a relative pointer to our config file. Set this configuration as default. You do not have to configure the projects individually.

<p>
To run the EMF Client Platform please include an EMF model in the launch configuration. For testing, you can use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emfstore/exampleModel.zip">this example model.</a> Import it into your EMFCP workspace and start it along with EMFCP. You should be able to create instances of the example model (bowling).
