	<h2>Demonstration of the core features of ECP</h2>
	<p>In the previous tutorial, you would have learned how to setup the Eclipse development environment for ECP. We also learnt how to import a project into the workspace using the Library tutorial and learnt how to run the ECP project. </p>
	
	<p>In this tutorial we will learn about the various components of the EMFCP.</p>
	<p>Let us consider the same library example we used in the previous tutorial.</p>

	<!-- About the Navigator component -->
	<b>Navigator</b>
	<p>The navigator is leftmost pane as shown in the below screenshot. 
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image2.png" alt="ECP navigator"/></p>
	You can create a new project by right-clicking and selecting <em>Other...->New Project...</em> and give a project name.
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image3.png" alt="New Project wizard"/></p>
	<p>Now you can add various components to the project by right-clicking on the project and select <em>New Model Element</em>. This brings up a dialog where you can choose the model element. Note that you can also type in the name of the model in the <em>Search</em> textbox to filter out the results</p>

	<!-- About the model editor -->
	<b>Editor</b>
	<p>Let us add the <b>Book</b> element for example and the when you do so, you get the Editor component where you can change the values. The editor is persistent as well, which means that when you type a name for the book, it gets persisted automatically.</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image6.png" alt="Book editor"/></p>
	<p>Now let us add a <b>Library</b> element to the project and when you right click on the added library element, you can see the various options like <em>New Book</em> and <em>New Writer</em> which are the "Containment" features (Book and Writer elements are contained in the Library elements)</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image7.png" alt="Library context menu"/></p>
	
	<!-- About Sharing the project -->
	<b>Dialogs</b>
	<p>The EMF Client Platform offers a lot of dialogs and let us look at some of them below. Let us add a new Writer element to the project as shown below</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image8.png" alt="Add Writer"/></p>
	<p>Now let us link the <b>Writer</b> we created to the <b>Book</b> element. To do this, click on the Link Author button corresponding to the author element in the Book.</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image9.png" alt="Link author"/></p>
	<p>This will pop-up a dialog where you can select which writer to link the book to. You can use the search box to search for the element</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image10.png" alt="Search author"/></p>
	<p>Select the Writer and click on Ok and you will see in the Book editor that the selected writer is "linked"</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image11.png" alt="Writer linked"/></p>
	
	<p>There is also a <b>Search</b> model element feature. In the navigator click on the Search button highlighted in the below screenshot. and it pops-up a dialog where you can search through the created model elements in the project</p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image13.png" alt="Search feature"/></p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/image14.png" alt="Dearch dialog"/></p>
	
	<b>Share Project</b>
	<p>Finally you can share the project to the server which will check-in the project into the EMF Store repository. Right-Click on the project and select <b>Share Project</b></p>
	<p><img width=700 src="images/share_project.png" alt="Share project"/></p>
	<p>Now, a dialog pops-up asking to select the user session. Select the session and your project will be committed to the repository.</p> 
	<p><img width=700 src="images/share_project_select_usersession_dialog.png" alt="Select Usersession"/></p>
	
	<p>You can cross verify this by opening the EMFStore View, login into the server and then expanding the directory tree.</p>
