	<h2>Developer Resources for the Juno version of EMF Client
		Platform</h2>

	<div style="margin: 10;">
		This tutorial describes how to install the workspace for the Juno
		branch of EMF Client Platform. Please note that this branch will not
		be compatible to version 0.9.x if you want to develop based on version
		0.9.x, please see <a href="gettinginvolved.php">here</a>.
	</div>
	<b>Step 1: Download and install Eclipse</b>
	<div style="margin: 10;">
		Please download and install Eclipse Modeling Tools 4.2 from <a
			href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads</a>
	</div>
	<b>Step 2: Additional Plug-Ins</b>
	<div style="margin: 10;">
		Install Checkstyle Plug-In from either the Marketplace
		(Help-&gt;Eclipse Marketplace...) or from the <a
			href="http://eclipse-cs.sf.net/update/">Checkstyle Updatesite</a>.
	</div>

	<b>Step 3: Check-out the source</b>
	<div style="margin: 10;">
		You can clone the following GIT repository: If you want to use GIT as
		a committer please use the following URI:
		<ul>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.ecp.core.git
				(ssh://committer_id@git.eclipse.org/gitroot/emfclient/org.eclipse.emf.ecp.core.git)</li>
		</ul>
		If you want to use GIT as an anonymous user (read only) please use the
		following URIs:
		<ul>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.ecp.core.git
				(git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/emfclient/org.eclipse.emf.ecp.core.git)</li>
		</ul>
		Select only the "master" branch. Press "Select all"
		and proceed with the import. <br /> <br /> Please refer to <a
			href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide/Remote#Cloning_remote_Repositories">this
			tutorial</a> to clone GIT repositories. <br /> <br /> Now, you can
		import the projects from the cloned GIT repository. <a
			href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/ImportGitProjects">See here how to
			import projects from a GIT repository</a>

	</div>

	<b>Step 4: Set the target</b>
	<div style="margin: 10;">Open the _target/ecp.target definition
		file. When it is resolved, set this definition as the target platform.
		If the target is not resolved, select the emfstore update site and
		press update again. The resolution of the target platform takes a
		while.</div>
	<b>Step 5: Start ECP</b>
	<div style="margin: 10;">
		For testing, you can use <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/emfstore/exampleModel.zip">this
			example model</a>. Import it into your EMFCP workspace.<br/> Go to Run->Run
		Configurations.. , select the "ECP" launch configuration. <br/>On the plug-ins
		tab select the added plugins in the tree view. Then press "Add required Plug-ins". <br/>Now
			you are ready to start ECP by pressing "Run".
	</div>
	<!-- 
		<p>
			Please install buckminster from this update site: <a
				href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/buckminster/updates-3.7">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/buckminster/updates-3.7</a>.
			You will need the following features:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Buckminster - Core</li>
			<li>Buckminster - Subversive Support</li>
			<li>Buckminster - PDE Support</li>
		</ul>
	 	
		<p>
			Please install the EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK from <a
				href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo">http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>For the target platfrom first create an empty project called
			"_target"</p>
		<p>Now create an empty target definition that Buckminster later can
			fill with the needed plug-ins (Windows->Preferences->Plugin
			Development->Target Platform)</p>
		<p>Add the directory location ${workspace_loc}/_target. Activate
			the platform</p>
		
		<p>Manually check-out the releng project from the other repository
			/ECP2</p>
			
		<p>To materialize the sources right-click the local.mspec, select
			Buckminster|Import... Click finish and wait until the import is
			finished, this might take several hours.</p>
	
	
		<p>
			The final step is to create a check style configuration. We are using
			checkstyle 5. Please open the global preferences (Window =>
			Preferences) and add a new Checkstyle configuration named
			"emfstoreStyle" with a relative pointer to our config file. Set this
			configuration as default. You do not have to configure the projects
			individually. <br>

	<h2>Extension points - How to</h2>
	<div style="margin: 10;">
		When adding a new extension point please mind the following guidelines:
		<ul>
			<li>The Plug-in ID must be the same as the id of the project defining the extension point.</li>
			<li>The Point ID must not be fully qualified. The name must be camel cased.</li>
			<li>The Point Name must be understandable and give a good hint at what the extension point is doing.</li>
			<li>The Description tab must contain a description for the extension point. If the point is experimental (API not fixed) add the following line:<br/>
				&lt;b&gt;This extension point is experimental and is likely to change in the future releases as the activity support evolves.&lt;/b&gt;
			</li>
			<li>The Since tab must contain the Version of the plugin since which it is part of the API. (Even if it is experimental). The Version format is maj.min, e.g. 1.1 . </li>
			<li>The Examples tab should contain an example of an usage of this extension point. Use the &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags to display markup.</li>
			<li>The API Information tab should contain a description of classes being used for defining this extension point.</li>
			<li>The Supplied Implementation tab should contain a description of a supplied implementation of this extension point, if one implementation is supplied.</li>
			<li>The Copyright tab must contain the copyright agreement, it look like this:<br/>
				<code>
