The EMF Client Platform is a framework to build EMF-based client applications. The goal is to provide a one-click application based on a given EMF model. Besides the EMF model no additional components have to be developed or generated. Therefore ECP provides a standard solution including the most common features needed for EMF-based client applications. This application can then be customized step by step. This can be done by extending ECP or replacing single components completly.
