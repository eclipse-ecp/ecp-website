<h4>Professional Support</h4>
<p>
Open-source software is free of licensing fees.
Furthermore, it is easy to adapt and enhance by new features. Nevertheless, using open-source frameworks is not for free. 
Like in closed-source software, not everybody is an expert for any framework. 
The total cost of ownership also includes training, adoption, enhancement and maintainance of a framework. 
It might take significantly longer for somebody new to the project to extend a certain feature than for the person who introduced it at the first place. 
Furthermore, software has to be maintained. 
Even if this can be done literally by everybody for open-source software, a professional maintaiance agreement with fixed response times is often manditory in an industrial setting. 
This ensures your productivity. EclipseSource employs several EMF Client Platform committers and <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/en/eclipse/eclipse-emf/">offers 
professional support</a> and <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/en/services/eclipse-training/">training</a>.
